In this programming project, you will implement a system capable of indexing the content of text data files (documents) and also perform searches based on words. All documents files are assumed to be ASCII files; where each character uses only 1 byte for its ASCII code. The search part will be able to find documents that contain at least one of the words in a list of words given, and show them in decreasing order of relevance based on a heuristic that will be described. Then the user can specify to display the whole content of particular documents that satisfy the search criteria. This system is not meant to work with a very large set of documents and words; we assume here that the data that will be needed to manage the different operations can all be in memory at the same time. If the system is too large, we cannot guarantee this; also, some of the data structures that we will suggest, although perhaps simpler, may not scale well if the volume of data becomes too large, perhaps causing low performance. Real search systems should be able to handle large volume of data.
